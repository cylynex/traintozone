  levelDescription: So there you were.  Sitting, minding your own business.  Then,
    out of nowhere, you hear it.  The stomping of feet.  The jingling of armor.  The
    loot bag scraping across the ground, lugged by an overweight warrior trying to
    escape.  That's right.  There's a train coming, and you are sitting right at the
    zone line.
